##### Debugging #####
- When I am login in, I am brought to an empty activity... it should be the home activity which now has a logout out button but it's all blank. Regardless of admin or user..
 ^ It is actually showing the right page, my constraints must be way off.

##### To Do ######

Recycler View is not working. Either it is not visibile, or I've done something wrong, could possibly be the "account" stuff

Pull all the users into the Recycler View
Admin right to delete



##### Done ######

I want to add a hidden field for the register:
if they select instructor, the price is 15
else participants is 20
Also zinid field is compulsory if registering as instructor
